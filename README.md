# About me
### 👋 Hi, I’m Emily (Pronouns: she/her)

I'm a graduate student in the Master of Engineering in Computer Science & Applications program at Virginia Tech, and my background spans clinical neuroscience, healthcare systems, and software engineering. I wasn’t originally planning to study CS, and during my undergraduate studies at Virginia Tech I was on the pre-medical track. My path changed after I graduated in 2020 and started working in a hospital system where I had the chance to build and automate processes for the clinical team I worked with. That experience helped me realize that I enjoyed creating tools and systems that improve how people work. My interests include software development, human-computer interaction (HCI), cybersecurity, and I will be graduating this spring (May 2026).

I'm currently working on projects that span healthcare, educaiton, and community service. Because of my background, I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome and steep learning curves, and I try to approach engineering with curiosity instead of perfectionism. I value creating simple systems that meet client needs. I enjoy improving documentation so that future-me and my teammates don't suffer. I'm still learning and am comfortable asking questions. I'm very open about and not afraid of not knowing everything.

I care a lot about the impact that my projects have on my clients and my community, and I strive to design and build systems that scale in usefulness over time. I enjoy mentoring, building tools that support underserved communities, and working on projects that blend **technical rigor with human-centered design**. I’m especially interested in how software can reduce friction in complex, high-stakes environments like healthcare and education.

## 🛠️ What I Like Building
- **Full-stack applications** (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React/Next.js)
- **Infrastructure-aware systems** (Docker, CI/CD, cloud deployment)
- **Data-driven tools** that support planning, visualization, and decision-making
- **Clean, maintainable architectures** with clear docs and thoughtful tradeoffs

## Projects I’m currently working on..
- **MCAT Study Platform** – A full-stack web application (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React/Next.js) that helps premedical students plan and track long-term MCAT study, with a focus on accessibility for low-income and underrepresented students.
- **Veterans@VT Website** – Designing and maintaining a responsive, student-facing website to centralize resources, events, and information for the Virginia Tech student veteran community.
- **Systems & Infrastructure Projects** – Coursework and side projects involving networking, security, and system design, with an emphasis on clean architecture, documentation, and reproducibility.
- **Portfolio & Developer Tooling** – Refining my personal portfolio, improving CI/CD workflows, and tightening project documentation across repos.
