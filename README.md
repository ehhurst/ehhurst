# About me
### 👋 Hi, I’m Emily
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

I’m a **Master of Engineering student in Computer Science & Applications at Virginia Tech**, with a background that spans **clinical neuroscience, healthcare systems, and software engineering**. I didn’t start out in CS—I found my way here after working in a hospital environment and realizing I cared less about writing notes and more about building systems that *actually make people’s work easier*.

These days, I’m focused on **full-stack development, systems design, and infrastructure-minded engineering**. I like projects that live at the intersection of **technical depth and real-world impact**, especially in healthcare, education, and community-focused spaces.

## 🛠️ What I Like Building
- **Full-stack applications** (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React/Next.js)
- **Infrastructure-aware systems** (Docker, CI/CD, cloud deployment)
- **Data-driven tools** that support planning, visualization, and decision-making
- **Clean, maintainable architectures** with clear docs and thoughtful tradeoffs

I care a lot about *why* something is built—not just how—and I enjoy designing systems that scale in usefulness over time.

---

## 🧠 How I Think About Engineering
- I value **clarity over cleverness**
- I prefer **simple systems that are easy to reason about**
- I document things so future-me (and teammates) don’t suffer
- I’m comfortable learning in public and asking questions

I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome and steep learning curves, and I try to approach engineering with curiosity instead of perfectionism.

## 🌱 Outside the Code
I enjoy mentoring, building tools that support underserved communities, and working on projects that blend **technical rigor with human-centered design**. I’m especially interested in how software can reduce friction in complex, high-stakes environments like healthcare and education.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on..
- **MCAT Study Platform** – A full-stack web application (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React/Next.js) that helps premedical students plan and track long-term MCAT study, with a focus on accessibility for low-income and underrepresented students.
- **Veterans@VT Website** – Designing and maintaining a responsive, student-facing website to centralize resources, events, and information for the Virginia Tech student veteran community.
- **Systems & Infrastructure Projects** – Coursework and side projects involving networking, security, and system design, with an emphasis on clean architecture, documentation, and reproducibility.
- **Portfolio & Developer Tooling** – Refining my personal portfolio, improving CI/CD workflows, and tightening project documentation across repos.
