# About me
### 👋 Hi, I’m Emily (Pronouns: she/her)

I'm a graduate student in the Master of Engineering in Computer Science & Applications program at Virginia Tech with a background that spans clinical neuroscience, healthcare systems, and software engineering. 

I didn’t originally plan to study computer science. During my undergraduate studies at Virginia Tech, I was on the pre-medical track, but after graduating in 2020 and working in a hospital system, my path shifted. I had the opportunity to build and automate tools for the clinical team I worked with and through that experience I discovered that I loved creating systems that make people’s work easier and more efficient.

My current interests include software development, human-computer interaction (HCI), and cybersecurity, with a strong focus on building tools that have meaningful, long-term impact. I care a lot about the impact that the projects I build have on clients and my community. I strive to design and build systems that scale in usefulness over time and I'm currently working on projects that span healthcare, educaiton, and community service. I enjoy mentoring, building tools that support underserved communities, and working on projects that blend technical rigor with human-centered design. I’m especially interested in how software can reduce friction in complex, high-stakes environments like healthcare and education.

Because of my background, I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome and steep learning curves, and I try to approach engineering with curiosity instead of perfectionism. I value creating simple systems that meet client needs. I enjoy improving documentation so that future-me and my teammates don't suffer. I'm still learning and am comfortable asking questions. I'm very open about and not afraid of not knowing everything.
